    "    \n",
    "2. What the Calculator Will Do\n",

    "+ The operation to perform and \n",
    "+ The two numbers to use with that operation.\n",
    "    When the program starts up it can use a loop to keep processing operations until the user indicates that they wish to\n",

    "    We can also use an if statement to select the operation to perform etc.\n",
    "    As such it will also build on several other features in Python that we have already been working with\n",

    "3. Getting Started\n",
